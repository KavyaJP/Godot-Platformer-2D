# 🎮 Godot Platformer 2D

Welcome to my **Godot Platformer 2D** repository!  
This project documents my learning journey while following a YouTube tutorial on building a **2D platformer game using Godot**.

This repo is mainly for **practice, experimentation, and understanding core 2D game development concepts** in Godot.

## 🚀 Tutorial Reference

This project is based on the following YouTube tutorial:

👉 https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?si=4OirUDeaAmzj4WNE

I followed the tutorial step-by-step, occasionally experimenting on my own and taking notes along the way.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Setting up a Godot 2D project
- Player movement (left/right, jump, gravity)
- Collision detection using CollisionShape2D
- Using TileMaps for platform levels
- Basic enemy behavior
- Scene hierarchy and node usage
- Signals and interactions
- Exporting a Godot project

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install **Godot Engine** (compatible with the tutorial version).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KavyaJP/Godot-Platformer-2D.git
   ```
3. Open Godot and import the project.
4. Run the Game scene.

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Add sound effects and background music
- More enemy types
- Multiple levels
- UI (menus, pause screen, game over)
- Polish animations and effects
